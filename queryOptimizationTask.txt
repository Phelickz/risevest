I will describe the steps I performed for optimization as follows:

I precomputed User Post Counts and the Latest Post CreatedAt by utilizing a GROUP BY operation 
on the posts table. This precomputation is achieved within a subquery named "user_posts." 
Instead of calculating the number of posts and the latest createdAt for each user separately, 
I condensed the process. As a result, I simplified the fundamental inquiry and reduced the overall 
number of calculations.

I performed a join operation on the Most Recent Post Dated. 
By linking the posts table with the previously precomputed "user_posts" subquery, 
I united the data based on both the userId and max_createdAt.

I precalculated the Latest Comment CreatedAt in a subquery labeled "latest_comment." 
Similar to the first step, I determined the maximum createdAt value for each post's comments. 
This preparation allowed for easy interaction with the most recent comments associated with each post.

I executed a join operation on the Latest Comment CreatedAt. 
This step enabled me to acquire the latest comment content for each post. 
I connected the "latest_comment" subquery with the posts table join in the primary query. 
By optimizing the query structure and utilizing precomputed values, 
I aimed to enhance query speed while minimizing the necessity for intricate subqueries and complex conditions. 
To further augment query performance, I made certain that relevant columns such as userId and 
createdAt are appropriately indexed.

QUERY:

SELECT
  users.id,
  users.name,
  posts.title,
  latest_comment.content
FROM users
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT
    userId,
    COUNT(id) AS post_count,
    MAX(createdAt) AS max_createdAt
  FROM posts
  GROUP BY userId
) AS user_posts ON users.id = user_posts.userId
LEFT JOIN posts ON user_posts.userId = posts.userId AND user_posts.max_createdAt = posts.createdAt
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT
    postId,
    content,
    MAX(createdAt) AS max_createdAt
  FROM comments
  GROUP BY postId
) AS latest_comment ON posts.id = latest_comment.postId AND user_posts.max_createdAt = latest_comment.max_createdAt
ORDER BY user_posts.post_count DESC
LIMIT 3;
